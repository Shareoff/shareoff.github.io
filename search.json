Thoughts about general software engineering, the startup culture in Israel, programming languages such as C++, D and Python. In other words, any professional musings I have that (hopefully) could be interesting.\nWho are you? My name is Sharon Hadas, and I’m a software developer currently working at a storage startup located in Tel Aviv called weka.io. This job has been posing many interesting challenges - for example, learning a language called D, also known as dlang, from scratch, as well as learning about the storage world. My background is mostly in C++, and so I felt I wanted a place to document my thoughts and things I have been learning. The D language community is relatively small, so there’s not a ton of resources around, and I was hoping my efforts could be useful to others.\nIn addition to writing about D, I spent a good few years honing my C++ skills, and I would like to keep myself fresh and practice my knowledge. It’s also very important to me to keep my C++ expertise up to date, because despite its reputation C++ in the last few years is actually changing quite fast.\nWhy “Obsessed With Details”? Because I love taking the deep dive into concepts and fully deconstructing them into tiny little details, where each nugget is easy enough to understand on its own.\nAre comments welcome? Yes! Part of the reason I created this blog is because I’d really like to have a richer community around me for professional discussion. Feel free to use the in-site comments system, or you can email me at sharonhadas7@gmail.com. I’d love to hear your thoughts!\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"About","uri":"/about/"}]
